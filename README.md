<b>University of Redlands Colloquium</b> <br>

Most of the files here are a web implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm at NOVA Portugal. It uses Mapbox for the visualization parts, so you'd need to add your token and map project whatnot code in the appropriate spots in index.php. Otherwise, if you were to throw this code onto a php/web server, you could get a visual result with: example.com/index.php?start=A&end=B. Similarly, you could get the length of the path with example.com/stats.php?start=A&end=B. Good times. The code was patched together and is presented here in a raw (and somewhat embarrassingly structured) form. I'll eventually go through and fix its many lame implementations. If they bug you more than me, fix them yourself. Unless otherwise stated, the files in this repo possess a MIT License.
